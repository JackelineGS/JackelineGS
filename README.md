## Projects under development

Itâ€™s hard to succinctly describe how ggplot2 works because it embodies a
deep philosophy of visualisation. However, in most cases you start with
`ggplot()`, supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping (with `aes()`). You
then add on layers (like `geom_point()` or `geom_histogram()`), scales
(like `scale_colour_brewer()`), faceting specifications (like
`facet_wrap()`) and coordinate systems (like `coord_flip()`).
