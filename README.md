### Hi this is Jackeline Garcia 👋

Welcome to my Github I am Jackeline and I currently I am bachelor in psychology at UNMSM and LABORATORIA bootcamp student

#### 🌱 About me: 

I am a front-end developer interested in developing technology projects that improve people's wellbeing and boost social development. Halfway through my career in health sciences I discovered programming where its difficulty and possibilities pushed me to learn it and generate creative solutions.
